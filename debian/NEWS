mozilla-devscripts (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  dh_xul-ext sets now the substitution variable xpi:Breaks for breaking with
  too old or too new XUL applications that are incompatible with the given
  XUL extension.

  You should add ${xpi:Breaks} to Breaks: in debian/control. This change is
  forward and backwards compatible. Therefore there is no need to require a
  newer version of mozilla-devscripts to build your XUL extension.
